A Word from VB Dude!

Well, hello. This is a neat first ever program I think posted on
Planet-Source-Code on saving image space with JPEGs. It was a neat
idea I thought, so, I just decided to do. (courtesy of JPEG Strip of
course!). So, feel free to use the code only if you have my permission.
E-mail me at: reychan@hotmail.com and ask!!!

Anyway, I think this is the first ever, but I'm not sure. What this
neat program does is that it removes uneeded comments, junk, on JPEGs
and stuff. Then it saves space. But back up your images before trying.
Some JPEGs may not WORK. So be aware and happy coding!
